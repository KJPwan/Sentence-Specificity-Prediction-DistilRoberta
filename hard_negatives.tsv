Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory that describes the behavior of matter and light.
A quantum state represents the physical condition of a quantum system.
Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where linked particles exhibit correlated properties regardless of the distance separating them.
The principle of superposition states that any two or more quantum states can be added together.
A qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of quantum information.
Quantum computing leverages principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations.
The Schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes over time.
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known.
A quantum gate is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits.
