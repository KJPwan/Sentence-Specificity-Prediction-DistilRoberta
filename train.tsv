Goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated, and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast.	3.14285714286
Jones ... does offer a brutal form of charisma.	2.66666666667

Visually fascinating ... an often intense character study about fathers and sons, loyalty and duty.	2.14285714286

an exceedingly clever piece of cinema.another great `what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller, coupled with some arresting effects, incandescent tones and stupendous performances	2.83333333333
Shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs, if you will -- that beneath the familiar, funny surface is a far bigger, far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to Earth for harvesting purposes.	4.0
A strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet.	2.42857142857
Dragonfly has no atmosphere, no tension -- nothing but Costner, flailing away. It's a buggy drag.	3.33333333333
As a kind of colorful, dramatized PBS program, Frida gets the job done. But, for that, why not watch a documentary?	3.0
Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb.	3.42857142857
Gloriously straight from the vagina.	1.4
I'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled, but, for those with at least a minimal appreciation of Woolf and Clarissa Dalloway, The Hours represents two of those well spent.	3.28571428571
Once (Kim) begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors, you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard.	3.2
The humor is forced and heavy-handed, and occasionally simply unpleasant.	2.42857142857
If Ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating, sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation, it is clearly a good thing.	3.42857142857

Nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition.	2.0
It wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7.00.	1.8
Complex, sinuously plotted and, somehow, off-puttingly cold.	2.0
Got some good, organic character work, lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging, imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour, dissipated length.	2.4
We want the funk - and this movie's got it.	1.57142857143
A reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility.	2.42857142857
The result is solemn and horrifying, yet strangely detached.	1.57142857143
A pretty funny movie, with most of the humor coming, as before, from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro.	3.66666666667
Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up: everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter.	2.66666666667
The reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that Myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies.	3.14285714286
In execution, this clever idea is far less funny than the original, Killers From Space.	2.83333333333
A fitfully amusing romp that, if nothing else, will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star, Frankie Muniz.	3.83333333333
It's a glorified sitcom, and a long, unfunny one at that.	1.85714285714
Moore's complex and important film is also, believe it or not, immensely entertaining, a David and Goliath story that's still very much playing itself out.	3.66666666667
Now as a former Gong Show addict, I'll admit it, my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show.	3.0

Not quite as miraculous as its DreamWorks makers would have you believe, but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions.	2.75
Michael Moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining, self-aggrandizing, politically motivated documentary-making, and he's got as potent a topic as ever here.	3.71428571429
It's a familiar story, but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence.	2.14285714286
A superlative B movie -- funny, sexy, and rousing.	1.33333333333
An authentically vague, but ultimately purposeless, study in total pandemonium.	2.5

Insomnia is one of the year's best films and Pacino gives one of his most daring, and complicated, performances.	4.0
It's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly.	1.83333333333
It's good, hard-edged stuff, violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done, morally alert and street-smart.	2.0
The first half bursts with a goofy energy previous Disney films only used for a few minutes here and there.	2.66666666667

Bond-inspired? Certainly. Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise? Let's hope not.	2.57142857143
It's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue, only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary, pasty lumpen.	3.5
There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility, not an event that is believable, not a confrontation that is not staged, not a moment that is not false.	2.5
There's no reason to miss Interview with the Assassin	3.0
Human Resources was a good, straightforward tale, but Time Out is better. It's haunting. It's like a poem.	3.33333333333
A subtle and well-crafted (for the most part) chiller.	1.6
A thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses Grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos.	3.0
A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud, violent and mindless.	2.0
Movie fans, get ready to take off...the other direction.	1.57142857143
Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them, Tarantula and other low- budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s, the movie is a silly (but not sophomoric) romp through horror and hellish conditions.	4.42857142857
This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt, it's the worst movie I've seen this summer.	1.8
Works as pretty contagious fun.	1.85714285714
Gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who, in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude, knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive.	2.6
As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice, the movie makes two hours feel like four.	2.0
Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an (emotionally at least) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested.	3.28571428571
Too much of the humor falls flat.	1.66666666667
You can watch, giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you've completely lowered your entertainment standards.	1.8
Being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good, no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke.	2.0
A first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home, but your ego and all your problems go with you.	2.14285714286
An action/thriller of the finest kind, evoking memories of Day of the Jackal, The French Connection, and Heat.	3.28571428571
The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal.	3.16666666667
A coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichs and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood.	2.28571428571
A dashing and absorbing outing with one of France's most inventive directors.	2.71428571429
About nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the American dream.	2.57142857143
Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and, along the way, expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds.	3.83333333333
``Nicholas Nickleby'' is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there's no new ``A Christmas Carol'' out in the theaters this year. Charlie Hunnam has the twinkling eyes, repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a Dickensian hero.	4.42857142857
Some actors steal scenes. Tom Green just gives them a bad odor. This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard, but he's the most obvious one.	4.14285714286
The magic (and original running time) of ace Japanimator Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away survives intact in BV's re-voiced version.	4.28571428571
Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre.	2.0
It's super- violent, super-serious and super-stupid.	1.83333333333
Schmaltzy and unfunny, Adam Sandler's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad, Little Nicky bad, 10 Worst List bad.	3.71428571429
This is wild surreal stuff, but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other.	2.83333333333
Escaping the studio, Piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie.	3.0
If (Jaglom's) latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling, some of its repartee is still worth hearing.	3.2
One of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art, ethics, and the cost of moral compromise.	1.625
It's endlessly inventive, consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage.	1.28571428571
A lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to Grant, who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the Atlantic love him.	3.28571428571
Draggin' about dragons	2.0
While I can't say it's on par with the first one, Stuart Little 2 is a light, fun cheese puff of a movie.	3.0
While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest, the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization, humor or plain old popcorn fun.	2.8
The plot grows thin soon, and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution.	2.14285714286
Steven Soderbergh's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting, quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life.	3.16666666667
It's a fun adventure movie for kids (of all ages) that like adventure.	2.28571428571
What's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children.	2.16666666667
A whole lot foul, freaky and funny.	1.0
Everybody loves a David and Goliath story, and this one is told almost entirely from David's point of view.	3.0
Wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message.	2.42857142857
On the right track to something that's creepy and effective ... It's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there.	2.42857142857
Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it, but ``Spider-Man'' certainly delivers the goods.	3.5
An awfully good, achingly human picture.	1.71428571429
The fact that The Rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays.	3.28571428571
Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give ``Scratch'' a second look.	3.42857142857
A brain twister, less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on Hollywood, success, artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy.	2.6
Few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director Neil Burger follows up with are terribly convincing, which is a pity, considering Barry's terrific performance.	3.42857142857
Led by Griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm, the cast has a lot of fun with the material.	2.71428571429
(N)o matter how much good will the actors generate, Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness.	2.0
The charm of Revolution OS is rather the way it introduces you to new, fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers.	3.28571428571
The director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship (most notably wretched sound design).	3.0
Poignant and delicately complex.	1.14285714286
A teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting, less symmetrical, less obviously cross-shaped creation.	2.42857142857
My oh my, is this an invigorating, electric movie.	1.5
Japanese director Shohei Imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime.	3.14285714286

Samira Makhmalbaf's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness, although, it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal	3.83333333333
Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts, this must have been a difficult shoot, but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well.	2.28571428571
The tonal shifts are jolting, and though Wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered, more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive.	3.42857142857
Not only a reminder of how they used to make movies, but also how they sometimes still can be made.	2.0
Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid, but when it has the temerity to run over two hours, you feel like winding up with a kick.	3.6
The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness.	2.0
The script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors.	1.625
The movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true. This is the stuff that Disney movies are made of.	2.57142857143
It's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread.	2.0
One Hour Photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight.	2.85714285714
Elvira fans could hardly ask for more.	2.66666666667
Savvy director Robert J. Siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense.	3.125
Mostly, (Goldbacher) just lets her complicated characters be unruly, confusing and, through it all, human.	3.33333333333
It has plenty of laughs. It just doesn't have much else... especially in a moral sense.	2.0
...a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs. It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual	3.0
You watch for that sense of openness, the little surprises.	1.85714285714
Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric.	1.85714285714
I don't think I laughed out loud once. And when you're talking about a slapstick comedy, that's a pretty big problem.	2.28571428571
Like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive, fitfully amusing, but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen.	2.5
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored, cheering the pratfalls but little else; their parents, wise folks that they are, read books.	1.6
It's like a ``Big Chill'' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang, only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists.	3.5
Feels haphazard, as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot.	2.42857142857
It's all pretty tame. The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it.	2.14285714286
Smart science fiction for grown-ups, with only a few false steps along the way.	2.14285714286
Although fairly involving as far as it goes, the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up Catholic or, really, anything.	2.57142857143
It may not be a huge cut of above the rest, but I enjoyed Barbershop. It's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters.	4.2
``The Mothman Prophecies'' is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls.	3.66666666667
Hatosy ... portrays young Brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety, not to mention a convincing brogue.	2.85714285714
There's enough science to make it count as educational, and enough beauty to make it unforgettable.	2.4
When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini, Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game.	3.6
It's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time.	2.85714285714
A dreadful live-action movie.	1.42857142857
This is not Chabrol's best, but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer.	3.85714285714
The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life, but also acknowledging the places, and the people, from whence you came.	2.28571428571
Clayburgh and Tambor are charming performers; neither of them deserves Eric Schaeffer.	3.5
Bourne, Jason Bourne. He can scale a building like a super hero, he can out-stealth any agent, he'll get the girl. He's Super Spy!	4.0
It's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate.	3.4
The Master of Disguise is funny--not ``ha ha'' funny, ``dead circus performer'' funny. And for all the wrong reasons besides.	3.0
Like the original, this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen's astringent wit.	2.85714285714
A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present.	3.25
More maudlin than sharp.	1.57142857143
If the movie were all comedy, it might work better. But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects, but not a willingness.	2.14285714286
Rabbit-Proof Fence will probably make you angry. But it will just as likely make you weep, and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker.	3.14285714286
The far future may be awesome to consider, but from period detail to matters of the heart, this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past.	2.6
Satisfyingly scarifying, fresh and old-fashioned at the same time.	2.125
Don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches...	2.0
In a way, the film feels like a breath of fresh air, but only to those that allow it in.	2.14285714286
The story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured (and torturing) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on.	3.28571428571
Intensely romantic, thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery.	1.875
It made me feel unclean, and I'm the guy who liked There's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies. Oh, and Booty Call.	3.16666666667
The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne.	1.85714285714
It grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration.	1.83333333333
It's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness, and where Human Nature should be ingratiating, it's just grating.	2.4
Disturbing and brilliant documentary.	1.5
The movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in Hollywood's hastier productions.	3.14285714286
It's all a rather shapeless good time...	1.33333333333
There's an energy to Y Tu Mam Tambin. Much of it comes from the brave, uninhibited performances by its lead actors.	3.42857142857
On the whole, the movie lacks wit, feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality.	2.14285714286
It picked me up, swung me around, and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film.	2.66666666667
Can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music	1.83333333333
Whatever one makes of its political edge, this is beautiful filmmaking from one of French cinema's master craftsmen.	2.83333333333
A vibrant, colorful, semimusical rendition.	1.75
The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain.	1.83333333333
Watching E.T now, in an era dominated by cold, loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas, one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision.	3.71428571429
A pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances.	2.14285714286
An ebullient Tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing.	3.71428571429
A candid and often fascinating documentary about a Pentecostal church in Dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services.	3.33333333333
Doesn't amount to much of anything.	1.0
Tully is in many ways the perfect festival film: a calm, self-assured portrait of small town regret, love, duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience.	3.33333333333
The story is a rather simplistic one: grief drives her, love drives him, and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me.	2.14285714286
Lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that Brown played in American culture as an athlete, a movie star, and an image of black indomitability.	4.0
Transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring, at times sublime, visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the X into the games.	3.28571428571
A very witty take on change, risk and romance, and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth.	2.42857142857
The problem is not that it's all derivative, because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes. The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material.	3.14285714286
An inexperienced director, Mehta has much to learn.	2.71428571429
Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on ``The Simpsons'' has.	3.0
We just don't really care too much about this love story. In that setting, their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting.	2.5
It won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke.	1.83333333333
On a cutting room floor somewhere lies...footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant, ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire.	3.0
Turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting.	1.57142857143
Has a solid emotional impact.	1.28571428571
Britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound, the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway.	3.6
The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career.	3.5
The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks, and the color palette, with lots of somber blues and pinks, is dreamy and evocative.	4.0
Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay.	4.14285714286
There's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good: stop buying tickets to these movies.	3.14285714286
Vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two English women.	3.42857142857
Borstal Boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking, the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy.	3.2
So much facile technique, such cute ideas, so little movie.	1.33333333333
Another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre.	3.0
A beautifully observed character piece.	1.71428571429
Meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment.	2.42857142857
Challenging, intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative. But it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle.	2.6
The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers.	3.57142857143
Family portrait of need, neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking.	2.57142857143
If you're willing to have fun with it, you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of Unfaithful.	2.57142857143
Lacks dramatic punch and depth.	1.28571428571
Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story.	2.28571428571
Malcolm McDowell is cool. Paul Bettany is cool. Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell? Cool.	3.71428571429
The name says it all. Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set.	4.0
It's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the National Basketball Association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy Lil' Bow Wow.	3.0
Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century.	1.57142857143
National Lampoon's Van Wilder may aim to be the next Animal House, but it more closely resembles this year's version of Tomcats.	3.8
As animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool, this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth.	2.57142857143

It's not only dull because we've seen (Eddie) Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death, but because the plot is equally hackneyed.	3.2
A dark, dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires.	2.33333333333
Kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults, provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people. 'Snow Dogs' has both.	4.28571428571
Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode, and brother Hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense.	4.0

U.S. audiences may find (Attal and Gainsbourg's) unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what Hollywood typically concocts.	3.57142857143
I have two words to say about Reign of Fire. Great dragons!	2.85714285714
I admire it and yet cannot recommend it, because it overstays its natural running time.	1.66666666667
Though it inspires some (out-of-field) creative thought, the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract.	2.28571428571
The plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back.	1.57142857143
Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged, as if filmed directly from a television monitor, while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich.	2.57142857143
Brown's saga, like many before his, makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie.	2.8
Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters.	3.5

Despite some charm and heart, this quirky soccer import is forgettable	2.33333333333

Metaphors abound, but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story.	1.85714285714
... works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once.	1.42857142857
Whether or not you buy Mr. Broomfield's findings, the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight, pale Mr. Broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover.	3.85714285714
Yes, one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong, determined monarch, but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature.	3.85714285714
A mostly believable, refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama.	2.5
Waydowntown is by no means a perfect film, but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality.	3.4
...too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be.	1.8
Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average, showing signs of potential for the sequels, but not giving us much this time around.	4.0
If you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry, this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then.	2.14285714286
Liman, of Swingers and Go, makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long, low-heat chase, interrupted by a middling car chase.	4.16666666667
(Janey) forgets about her other obligations, leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes, maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies.	3.0
Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party.	3.85714285714
Too ordinary to restore (Harmon) to prominence, despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors, and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience.	3.16666666667

The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer.	2.33333333333
What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron, deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence.	3.5
Branagh, in his most forceful non-Shakespeare screen performance, grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit.	3.5
In a summer overrun with movies dominated by CGI aliens and super heroes, it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people, a project in which the script and characters hold sway.	3.57142857143
What goes on for the 110 minutes of ``Panic Room'' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals.	4.42857142857
You could say that it's slow at times, you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't, but one thing you couldn't say is that Alias Betty is predictable.	3.14285714286
UB equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture,' even as it points out how inseparable the two are.	3.625
It's up to (Watts) to lend credibility to this strange scenario, and her presence succeeds in making us believe.	3.28571428571
A terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi.	2.57142857143
Stands as a document of what it felt like to be a New Yorker -- or, really, to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11.	2.66666666667
The sentimental script has problems, but the actors pick up the slack.	1.83333333333
In the real world, an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a rsum loaded with credits like ``Girl in Bar #3.''	2.5
If you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies, what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever.	3.33333333333
Quite funny for the type of movie it is...	1.14285714286

Michel Piccoli's moving performance is this films reason for being.	3.14285714286
Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller, you know death is lurking around the corner, just waiting to spoil things.	3.0
And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence's over-indulgent tirade, then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest. If you are willing to do this, then you so crazy!	4.0
A feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about.	1.71428571429

Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up.	3.33333333333
It's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion.	4.28571428571
As the dominant Christine, Sylvie Testud is icily brilliant.	3.28571428571
``The Time Machine'' is a movie that has no interest in itself. It doesn't believe in itself, it has no sense of humor...it's just plain bored.	3.2
Corny, schmaltzy and predictable, but still manages to be kind of heartwarming, nonetheless. It's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain. At all.	2.33333333333
He's the scariest guy you'll see all summer.	1.71428571429

Heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on Petter Nss' delicate, clever direction ... and a wonderful, imaginative script by Axel Hellstenius.	4.0
When not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack, the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since Macy Gray's game of Chinese whispers with Mr Bean.	2.85714285714
What makes this film special is Serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context.	4.0

There is a refreshing absence of cynicism in Stuart Little 2--quite a rarity, even in the family film market. Eventually, it wins you over.	3.14285714286
Sweet Home Alabama is one dumb movie, but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end.	3.42857142857
Seems like someone going through the motions.	1.57142857143

Director David Fincher and writer David Koepp can't sustain it.	3.57142857143
There's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions, nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan, but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense, lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity.	2.4
It's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long.	2.42857142857
The film starts out as competent but unremarkable ... and gradually grows into something of considerable power.	1.71428571429
I have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration, but I've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than I want to believe.	2.33333333333
It is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style.	1.83333333333
Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse.	3.2
For all its failed connections, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is nurturing, in a gauzy, dithering way.	3.71428571429
With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake.	3.57142857143
What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background, you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song.	3.66666666667
An extremely unpleasant film.	1.28571428571
Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question: Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions?	3.5
Others, more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge', or more willing to see with their own eyes, will find Morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating.	3.28571428571
Broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force.	4.0
Amazing! A college story that works even without vulgarity, sex scenes, and cussing!	3.0

LaBute's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering.	2.875
His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude, calculated to provoke shocked laughter, without following up on a deeper level.	2.66666666667
The film aims to be funny, uplifting and moving, sometimes all at once. The extent to which it succeeds is impressive.	2.14285714286
An important movie, a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values.	1.6

Director Paul Cox's unorthodox, abstract approach to visualizing Nijinsky's diaries is both stimulating and demanding.	3.2
A small movie with a big impact.	1.57142857143
Lacking gravitas, MacDowell is a placeholder for grief, and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel. Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine.	3.42857142857
... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental.	2.14285714286
Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper, with special effects tossed in.	2.8
While it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting, brisk delight.	3.14285714286
Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak, as are most of the subplots. This one's weaker than most.	3.42857142857
Bravo for history rewritten, and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love.	2.28571428571
A real clunker. A well-made, thoughtful, well-acted clunker, but a clunker nonetheless.	2.0

It treats Ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film.	3.16666666667

Just a Kiss is a just a waste.	3.0
Resourceful and ingenious entertainment.	1.66666666667
All of the elements are in place for a great film noir, but director George Hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat.	3.85714285714
The central story lacks punch.	1.16666666667
Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed, Metropolis is a feast for the eyes.	2.8
Reign of Fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way.	3.0
The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys.	3.5
Red Dragon makes one appreciate Silence of the Lambs.	3.625
This real-life Hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies Hollywood produces.	2.16666666667
Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession.	2.6
While obviously aimed at kids, The Country Bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio.	3.33333333333
A smart and funny, albeit sometimes superficial, cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist.	2.625
Invigorating, surreal, and resonant with a rainbow of emotion.	1.85714285714
Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss. But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film, which is often preachy and poorly acted.	3.2

Ryan Gosling is, in a word, brilliant as the conflicted Daniel.	3.57142857143

One of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade.	1.83333333333
The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads, etc. -- to do the subject matter justice.	2.71428571429

A fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion.	2.42857142857
The formula is familiar but enjoyable.	1.14285714286

An overblown clunker full of bad jokes, howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences.	2.14285714286
Might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people.	1.8
This franchise has not spawned a single good film. The crap continues.	1.71428571429
It's a thin notion, repetitively stretched out to feature length, awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects, droning house music and flat, flat dialogue.	2.71428571429
One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud.	2.28571428571
It's hard to imagine any recent film, independent or otherwise, that makes as much of a mess as this one.	1.8

While the story's undeniably hard to follow, Iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce.	2.71428571429
To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree.	2.6

What's so striking about Jolie's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair.	3.5

Graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in American teen comedies.	2.625

What bubbles up out of John C. Walsh's Pipe Dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch.	4.16666666667
Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots.	2.14285714286
A heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope.	2.2

...standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added.	2.28571428571
There is so much plodding sensitivity.	1.57142857143
Rare Birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable.	3.2

Subversive, meditative, clinical and poetic, The Piano Teacher is a daring work of genius.	3.83333333333
... an agreeable time-wasting device -- but George Pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs.	3.14285714286

The saturation bombing of Reggio's images and Glass' evocative music ... ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning.	3.57142857143
Director Nalin Pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other. He simply presents his point of view that Ayurveda works. No question.	3.83333333333
A depraved, incoherent, instantly disposable piece of hackery.	1.28571428571
A rollicking ride, with jaw-dropping action sequences, striking villains, a gorgeous color palette, astounding technology, stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending.	2.85714285714
Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea, the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand.	4.42857142857
The video work is so grainy and rough, so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up, that it's exhausting to watch.	2.85714285714
Both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy, What Time Is It There? may prove to be (Tsai's) masterpiece.	3.0
Coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that, despite a fairly slow paced, almost humdrum approach to character development, still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema.	4.0
Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers.	2.42857142857
It is great summer fun to watch Arnold and his buddy Gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters.	3.2
Satin Rouge is not a new, or inventive, journey, but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional, average, middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity.	4.0
A richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind.	2.0
Its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes, which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway.	2.71428571429
What a great way to spend 4 units of your day.	1.0
The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge. These are names to remember, in order to avoid them in the future.	4.6

The year's happiest surprise, a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way.	1.8
A wonderful character-based comedy.	1.66666666667
A worthwhile documentary, whether you're into rap or not, even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll.	3.2
Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books, they can't go wrong. Better effects, better acting and a hilarious Kenneth Branagh. An excellent sequel.	3.5

Phillip Noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer, Christopher Doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of Greene's prose, and it's there on the screen in their version of The Quiet American.	4.28571428571

Call it magic realism or surrealism, but Miss Wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity.	3.0
Birot is a competent enough filmmaker, but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it.	2.8
The magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances.	2.14285714286
