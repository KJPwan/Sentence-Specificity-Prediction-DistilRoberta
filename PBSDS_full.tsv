"If fat bodies disgust someone , they want to make out that nobody would get or remain fat if we just did X , Y , and Z . The possibility that they or their loved ones might become fat is thereby staved off--it's all down to a lack of willpower , which they and their loved ones possess"	0

Update : lecture was an absolute banger . One of the best public talks I've ever seen .	0
"US anti-abortion activists overwhelmingly don't care about maternal mortality ; state-sanctioned executions of Black and brown folks ; water quality in places like Flint , MI ; health care ; the death penalty ; animals brutally slaughtered by factory farms . THIS IS NOT ABOUT LIFE"	0
Wait . Now I don't see it . My case is only strengthening	0
"We are not just told what to do . Nor are we merely complicit . We are actively recruited , made agents , in our own oppressive lifestyles ."	0
"We are told , as women , that our pleasure is irrelevant and that our needs should be minimized . We are taught not only to be quiet , but to be small , neat , sweet , and pliant ."	0
We don't talk about Wordle no no no	0
"We must dig in , in multiple senses , in order to refuse this ."	0
"We'll be talking about misogyny , bodies , fatness , giving , and more ."	0
"Welcome to America , where we care so much about life that the guns of boys and men proliferate while girls , women , and other pregnant people routinely die for lack of access to abortion"	0
"What a fascinating way to share your deep concern about our health as fat people : contempt , horror , condescension , and pity--plus the suggestion we don't deserve to be publicly visible ."	0
What if--hear me out--we just stopped indulging wealthy white men	0
"What is the better working title for my book on the systemic oppression and violence of fatphobia , and the need to resist it (and , with it , diet culture) ?"	0
"What opaque tights are good now ? It's been sooooo long since I've worn a skirt I no longer know . I like them super , super , super opaque , and . . . comfortable ? idk ."	0
"Whatever else we learn about this heinous crime , what we now know suggests that Long has a great deal in common with incels . Who are misogynists and often racists who care more about hierarchies than sex per se . They insist on being looked up to--and not being made to feel shame ."	0
Whatever : few things feel as good to me as writing again .	0
"When a white man attributes his feelings of shame to a woman--because she has left him , or she is sexually unavailable to him in the first place or , alternatively , because she is deemed too sexually *available* and therefore a source of illicit temptation--she is often in danger ."	0
"When I am queen of the world , I will cancel cancel cancel culture culture"	0
"When is non-binary Parents' Day ? I innocently asked my spouse . Only to learn that this is a joke Ben Shapiro has made repeatedly , scoffing that this is what "" libs "" want . Um , yes ? Obviously yes ?"	0
"When some "" good "" women are put on a pedestal , misogyny toward "" bad "" women almost inevitably follows ."	0
"Whether it's a hijab or a hoodie or a mask , wearing anything that obscures your face or reduces your social legibility is hella controversial , and garners ridiculous displays of aggression"	0
"While minor updates to make language more inclusive and accurate are attracting such silly wrath , the real issue--that we're seeing the systematic decimation of the right to bodily autonomy and self-determination for pregnant people AND trans folks in this country--gets forgotten"	0
Who edited this ? Do better .	0
"Why is CRT is upsetting to many white folks ? While it's true CRT emphasizes the systemic nature of racism , and has little time or use for white shame , guilt , and self-blame , it simply does depict many white people and their ancestors in ways that are morally unflattering ."	0
"With the new year pressing down on us , a quick reminder : misogyny and fatphobia are deeply entangled . Within a patriarchal culture , we are trained not to take up too much space , and not to indulge our appetites—or even , oftentimes , to satisfy our hunger ."	0
"Women are punished for being perceived as withholding and failing to give , I think ; being "" cold , callous , and heartless ; "" neglecting their natural duty to provide safe haven and nurture , by evicting a vulnerable being from their rightful home , their birthright ."	0
Women : not your fucking giving tree .	0
"Worried for everyone at Cornell right now . No idea what's going on , but people in my building and others have been told to shelter in place , now evacuate . Stay safe ."	0
"Would he ever compare amd describe two male philosophers in this way ? Thought not . Another completely unnecessary line : "" [But] her husband left her , ostensibly because she couldn’t have children , and she withdrew in misery from the public scene . """	0
Would that white women showing their whole asses in acceptance speeches were not an entire genre	0
"Writing a syllabus always induces in me the same sensation as planning a birthday party : huge anxiety borne out of a desire that everybody has a good time , plus a deep sense of inadequacy to be ensuring as much ."	0
Yes yes I know exercise is good for you . I compromise by walking places at my own pace listening to podcasts .	0
"Yes , I think this has something to do with the reception of Bad Art Friend ."	0
"You can depict someone in an unflattering way without holding them individually responsible for anything , or accusing them , or blaming them . It may still be psychically threatening and hard to take for a group accustomed to moral privilege : being regarded and depicted as good ."	0
"2020 , the year of the global pandemic , was in many ways an urgent wake-up call for humanity – demonstrating perhaps more clearly than ever that our conventional models of reality are deeply out of sync with the real world"	0
